# Open CF Summit Presentation - WebSockets Now!

Here are some of my source code I showed in the presentation. Keep in mind that I was showing a very bare bones example, so in many situations, there's little or no files to share. The bigger issue is setting up the WebSockets gateways, most of which occur via GitHub projects or the built in extension managers. See my presentation (link below) for that information. 

Some of this code may not work - no warranty or support whatsoever. :-)
